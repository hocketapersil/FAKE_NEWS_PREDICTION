## **Problem Statement**

### **Introduction**
Fake news has emerged as one of the most significant challenges of our time, severely impacting both online and offline discourse. Its proliferation poses a direct threat to the democratic processes and societal stability, particularly in the western world. The ability to accurately identify and reduce the spread of fake news is essential to maintaining informed public discourse and safeguarding democratic institutions.

### **Problem Statement**
The primary challenge addressed by this project is the automatic detection of fake news articles using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By developing a reliable model to classify news articles as either fake or real, we aim to contribute to the efforts to curb the spread of misinformation and enhance the quality of information available to the public.

### **Aim of the Project**

The aim of this project is to build a robust and accurate fake news detection system.

### **How Does the Solution Solve the Problem?**

The proposed solution involves developing a machine learning model that leverages NLP and deep learning techniques to classify news articles as fake or real, allowing users to input news articles and classify them as fake or real, thereby providing a valuable tool for combating misinformation.


### **About the Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains labeled news articles, categorized as either fake or real. This dataset is essential for training and evaluating the machine learning models developed to detect fake news.

### **Content**
The dataset comprises rows and columns that represent various attributes of news articles, including their textual content and labels indicating whether they are fake or real. The dataset includes information on how it was acquired and the time period it represents, providing valuable context for the analysis.
